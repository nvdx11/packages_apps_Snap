# Snapdragon Camera
**Pure Codeaurora SnapdragonCamera built from official codeaurora sources and also the LineageOS Snap. The other branches 
are just the base CAF branches. The branch 'n' has some more commits on top of the Pure CAF branch. The branch Snap is 
the base branch for the LineageOS Snap camera, and the branch 'n2' has some more commits over the Lineage Snap fork. 
However, this is where I push and keep all variants of Snapdragon Camera I play with. There is no reason for keeping 'n' 
as a default branch. The active branches are 'n' - Pure CAF one with my modifications which are necessary and the 'n2' - 
branch which is the Snap camera with my modifcations.** **_Please give proper credits if this is used._**
